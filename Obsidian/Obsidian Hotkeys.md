Hotkeys, (or keyboard shortcuts) are really useful for navigating Obsidian, since there's a lot of functionality built-in, and find the the tool you're looking for in the menus can be annoying. 

## Default Hotkeys
### Global 
|Command        | Description   |
|---------------|---------------|
|`CMD + P`^COMMANDPALLET|Opens command palette|
|`CMD + G`| Opens the Graph view |
|`CMD + Option + Left Arrow` | Navigate back|
|`CMD + Option + Right Arrow` | Navigate forward|
|`CMD + ','`^OPENSETTINGS | Open settings|

### Editor

|Command|Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `CMD + K`  | Creates Link|
| `CMD + N` | Creates a new Note|
| `CMD + E` | Toggles edit/preview mode|
| `CMD + W`| Closes the active pane|
|`CMD + O`| Opens quick switcher |

## Custom Hotkeys
Commands are very powerful in Obsidian. Thankfully, any command can be mapped to a keyboard shortcut. 
### Creating Custom Hotkeys
1. [[Obsidian Hotkeys#^OPENSETTINGS|Open settings]] and go to the **Hotkeys**
section. Here, you can see all of the commands, and the hotkeys assigned to them. 
2. Search for the command you want to assign. For example, search *Bookmarks: Bookmark*, which is a command used for creating bookmarks
3. Click the '+' icon next to the command
4. Press the keys you want to assign to the hotkey. For example, if I press `CMD + Option + B`, that hotkey will be recorded, allowing me to run that command with that key combination.
5. If the hotkey is already assigned, you can remove the hotkey, or reassign existing hotkeys to avoid conflicts
