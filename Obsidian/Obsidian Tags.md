Tags can be useful in Obsidian. They can be used to mark notes with properties, which can be useful for searching. Unlike links however, they do not appear in the graph view, and they cannot currently be applied to all types of documents (eg. Canvas). Because of this, tags can be though of as supplemental properties, not foundational ones. 

For example, I might be reading *Driven To Distraction*, and I might quote the book. (See *Driven To Distraction*)

Here, the subject matter's foundational topic is ADD, with other possible links to unemployment, addiction, and eating disorders, each of which are topics of their own. Conversely, if I want to denote this excerpt as a quote, I can add this property as a tag, without needing to relate this document to one I make on quotes. 
## Adding Tags
There are 2 ways to add tags. The first is to use a triple dash '---' at the top of the page, as show below:
```
---
tags: 
	- TagName
---
```

The second method is to use the '#' inline with your text:
```
This is some sample content \#Tag
```
> [!note]
> In this example, I've included a '\\' because I don't want to create a tag named 'Tag'. In your usage, omit the '\\'
